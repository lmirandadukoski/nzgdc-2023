This section of the project demonstrates how to construct UI using VisualTree or entirely through C# code.

Each of these methods is demonstrated in a separate folder, 0_VisualTree and 1_Code, respectively. Both methods were
used to construct the same EditorWindow.

To view the resulting windows, please go to NZGDC23Demo > 00_Structure from the top ribbon menu and select one of the menu options.
