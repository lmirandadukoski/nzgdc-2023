This section of the project demonstrates how to style UI using style sheets or through C# code.

Each of these methods is demonstrated in a separate folder, 0_USS and 1_Code, respectively. Both methods were
used to style the same runtime Settings panel.

To view the various visual beahviours applied at runtime, please load scene Assets/01_Style/StyleExamples.unity,
and enable one of the game objects under the EnableOneAtATime game object.
