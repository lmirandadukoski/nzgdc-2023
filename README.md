Code samples for my NZGDC 2023 presentation titled "Building UI with UI Toolkit"

There are three main sections:
1. Structure: Demonstrates the basic of constructing UI using the VisualTree (Assets/00_Structure/0_VisualTree). The same result can be achieve entirely by code (Assets/00_Structure/1_Code).
2. Style: Demonstrates how to apply layouts and visual configurations to the elements of UI using UIBuilder and Style Sheets (Assets/01_Style/0_USS) or by code (Assets/01_Style/1_Code).
3. Behaviour: Demonstrates how to control the behaviour of UI elements through events.

Each section contains a README file that provides additional context and instructions.
